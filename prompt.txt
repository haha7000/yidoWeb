RECEIPT_PROMPT = """
    Please convert the receipt OCR results into the JSON format below. Include only the specified keys, and do not include any keys other than those mentioned.

    The conditions for each field are as follows:

    - "receiptNumber": The receipt number consists of numbers only and should be entered without spaces or hyphens. 
      For **LOTTE**, the receipt number must be **exactly 14 digits**. 
      If you cannot find exactly 14 digits, return an empty string ("").
      This number is located **below** `www.lottedfs.com` or `kr.lottedfs.com` and **above** `SaleDT` and `SysDT`. 
      For example, it follows a format like `902087-24-000593`, which consists of 6 digits-2 digits-6 digits. 
      For **SHILLA**, the receipt number is a total of **13 digits**.

      ‚ÄúSince a single image may contain multiple receipts, please extract all receipt numbers.‚Äù
    
    

    The output should only include the following keys:
    {
        "receiptNumber": "90208724000593", "92208724004591"
    }

    Please convert the passport OCR results into the JSON format below, including only the specified keys. 
    Do not include any other keys besides the ones mentioned.

    The conditions for each field are as follows:

    - "name": Ignore Chinese characters and extract only the name in uppercase English letters. 
      For Chinese passports, the surname (family name) should come first, followed by the given name, 
      separated by a space. If the order is reversed, rearrange it correctly so that the surname is first. 
      The name should consist of at least two words. 
      If no English name is detected, enter an empty string. 
      Example: "ZHANG SAN"

    - "passportNumber": The passport number is a total of **9 characters**, with the first **1-2 characters** 
      being uppercase English letters, and the rest being numbers. 
      **If a lowercase 'l' or uppercase 'I' is detected, it should be considered as the digit '1'.** 
      If it doesn't meet this format, enter an empty string.

    - "birthDay": Extract the birth date from the OCR and format it as "DD MMM YYYY" (e.g., "09 Jun 1994"), where:
        - DD: Two-digit day (01-31)
        - MMM: Three-letter English month abbreviation with the first letter uppercase and the rest lowercase 
          (e.g., Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)
        - YYYY: Four-digit year
      If no birth date is detected or the format cannot be met, enter an empty string.

    Only the following keys should be present in the output:
    {
        "name": "ZHANG SAN",
        "passportNumber": "AS1234567",
